Hello! I'm a third-year Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering student with a curious and creative mind. I enjoy applying and fortifying the knowledge I learn through various projects. 

Some examples of projects I have worked on are:
- An Autonomous/Manual Gripper robot (applied my CAD, Sofwaere, and Electronics design knowledge)
  
- An dual Square-Wave and Triangular-Wave Oscillator acompanied by a 5-Step Sequencer to make it play a sequence of notes (applied my Electronic design knowledge)
  
- A PLC-Operated production line using the Siemens TIA Portal STEP 7 software for which I specifically worked on the sorting part of the assembly line (applied my LAD and FBD programming knowledge as-well as my understanding of sensors and actuators)

- An Autonomous Pet Feeder (applied my CAD design knowledge)
